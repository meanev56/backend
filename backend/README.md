### To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/NewSmoke38/intro-to-backend

```
2. **Install all the Dependencies:**

```sh
npm install
```

3. **Set up your environment variables:**

-> Create a new file in the root of the project named .env

-> Copy the contents from the example below and add your own values (like your database connection string).

```.env
PORT=4000
MONGODB_URI="your_mongodb_connection_string_here"

```


4. **Start the Server:**

```sh
